            Hello, I'm Laiba, a Computer Science student at Bahria University with a passion for using code to solve real-world problems. Throughout my studies, I’ve gained a deep understanding of algorithms, software development, and the latest in tech innovations.
            My primary focus is data, particularly in the areas of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and web technologies, I’m able to effectively manipulate and analyze data, while building dynamic and scalable applications.
            Beyond my technical skills, I have a creative side as well. I love working with design tools like Figma and Canva to bring personal projects and ideas to life. Recently, I've delved into creating whiteboard animations, an exciting challenge that has sharpened my design thinking and creative problem-solving abilities.
            Feel free to explore my portfolio, where you'll find an assortment of my academic projects, personal work, and the technologies I'm currently learning. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat about tech, don’t hesitate to reach out!
