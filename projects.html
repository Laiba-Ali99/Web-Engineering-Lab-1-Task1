                <h2>AcademeXperience: Learning Management System (LMS)</h2>
                <p>
                    I developed AcademeXperience, a user-friendly Learning Management System (LMS) using NetBeans and MS SQL Server, designed to enhance course management and communication for educational institutions. 
                    The system integrates key features such as Q&A forums and announcements, promoting real-time interaction between students, teachers, and administrators. 
                    The LMS streamlines course delivery and fosters an engaging educational environment.

                <h2>PakWheels UI Redesign for Enhanced User Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I redesigned the user interface of the PakWheels website using Figma to improve overall user experience. 
                    The goal was to create a more intuitive, visually appealing design with easier navigation. 
                    I focused on streamlining the layout, enhancing accessibility, and optimizing mobile responsiveness. 
                    The redesign also included modernizing the color scheme and typography for a fresher look. 
                    This project showcases my skills in UI design and user-centered thinking.

                <p>
                    I designed the user interface for the PawShelter pet adoption website using Figma, aiming to create an intuitive and engaging experience for potential pet adopters. 
                    The design focused on a clean, easy-to-navigate layout with vibrant visuals to highlight adoptable pets. 
                    I incorporated user-friendly features such as filtering options, clear calls to action, and a responsive design for both desktop. 
                    The overall goal was to make the adoption process seamless and enjoyable.

                <h2>Whiteboard Animation</h2>
                <p>
                    I created a whiteboard animation video using Mango Animate to explain the concept of blockchain. 
                    The video breaks down complex blockchain principles into easy-to-understand visuals, making the topic accessible to a wide audience. 
                    Through engaging illustrations and clear narration, the animation simplifies blockchain technology and its applications.
